{"name":"Lunch","tagline":"A Group Lunch Stats / Chooser server","body":"lunch[![Travis build status](http://travis-ci.org/shhQuiet/lunch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/shhQuiet/lunch)\r\n=====\r\n\r\n**lunch** is a node.js server that uses [**mongodb**](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native) as a data store and [**express**](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) as an HTTP router.\r\n\r\n**lunch** responds to HTTP REST requests for:\r\n\r\n- _places_ - Locations of places to eat lunch.\r\n- _visits_ - A log of visits to locations\r\n- _users_ - People that may or may not have lunch.\r\n\r\nThe server is completely agnostic toward the contents of the objects.  It only maintains the relationships between the objects in the collections:\r\n\r\n_places_ can have zero or more _visits_\r\n\r\n_visits_ can have zero or more _users_ that were present during the visit\r\n\r\n_visits_ can have only one _place_\r\n\r\nconfiguration\r\n=============\r\n\r\n**lunch** uses [**nconf**](https://github.com/flatiron/nconf) for application configuration.  The file `config.json` contains the default configuration information:\r\n\r\n- default port is `3000`\r\n- The default database is `localhost` at the default mongodb port of `27017`.  DB name: `lunch`\r\n\r\nYou may change these values in the environment or on the command line or by changing config.json.\r\n\r\nFor example, to connect to a different database:\r\n\r\n`$ node server.js --database:url=mongodb://myHost.com:12345/someDb`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
